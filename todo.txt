-Charge parts sometimes linger
-Why chars spawn on same team next to eachother?
-Dash hitbox: only shorten on ground
-Comp shouldn't turn around when frozen
-Can't be on red
-Ai stuck climbing walls sometimes (esp. zero)
-AI 

-More maps:
  -Boomer kwanger (no new features needed)
  -Launch octopus (underwater coding)

-Charged tornado jump effect
-Homing torpedo better behavior

-MTV issue: log it to a DB or somewhere whenever it happens

-System of abstraction for handling collisions between entities
  -Electric spark should destroy charged rolling shield, but not regular
  -Enemy bullets should destroy homing torpedo, but not friendly ones
  -Enemies should trigger with sled, but not allies
-Register collision for non-trigger too
  -There aren't many use case sfor this, only one so far was penguin sled
-Bug: when 2 projectiles are right inside each other, they behave strangely. investigate
-MTV occasionally snaps out too far
-DOM nodes growing and not getting GC'd
-Have a level loading screen that only loads level backgrounds/music
-Sprite transitions screw up win animation alignment
-Some MTV issues (snapping out). Test the climb in gallery stage, and inclines
-Stage music continues playing in menu if quit right when it starts
-Climbing down ladders broken sometimes
-If pushing against wall don't play run animation
-Soft collision with allies
-AI should switch weapons that have no ammo
-Walls stop weapons
-AI Use charged weapons

===============
Abstraction
===============
-Investigate why debugging in Chrome is broken
-Refactor how AI holds buttons
-CheckCollisionActor, add gameobject array param
-Object instantiation

===============
Optimization
===============

-Performance concerns: death effect, change sprite indexof 
-Figure out how to measure GPU performance precisely
-Avoid new's
-Object pool for actors
-Only draw things on-screen
-Use particle containers for:
  -HUD stuff
  -Backgrounds
  -Effects

===============
Level editor
===============
-Rename sprites/levels/etc
-Remember last tool used and keep it open
-Basic undo
-The json data binding is weird/has issues
-be able to select under images/change z-order
-Rectangle select on the spritesheet canvas

LEVEL EDITOR DOCS
========================
Non-serializable code locations:
helpers.js: Search for 
  function serializeES6(obj) {
levelEditor.js: Search for
  saveLevel() {
sprite path saving is automatic using the name. 
onDeserialize() and onSerialize() of the classes that you are deserializing/serializing.
